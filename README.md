### About

This database will be set up for a small coffee roaster that also has a front end coffee shop business which will service individuals on a small scale selling different coffee options as well as things to eat and other drinks for resale (bottled water, juice and options other than coffee). The wholesale side will be focused on selling beans in bigger volumes greater than 5lbs.

The primary focus of the cafe will be to sell smaller priced items such as individual coffees, 1lb bag of beans and other items (maybe some utensils such as mugs and coffee makers). Primarily there will be smaller transactions involving baristas who both man the cash register as well as make coffee for customers. Occasionally the owner will step in to help out on busy days.

On the Roastery side we will see them selling beans on wholesale quantities as well as the main operations (Accounting, management, marketing as well as the roasters themselves).
